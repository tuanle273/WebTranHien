                            <p class="lead">Adolescence is a short but very important period in every person's life. It is a transitional period from people as children who need protection, care and education to people as adult citizens who can be held accountable to society and the law for all their actions. his vi. Born and raised in the doi moi period and in the market economy, Vietnamese adolescents today are facing many new and complex problems, advantages and difficulties, risks and challenges. knowledge, what they need to do to have the right awareness, attitude and behavior, to promote their abilities and intelligence, to contribute to the cause of industrialization and modernization and to become the owners the real future of the country.
                                
                                   
                                Especially in today's information technology era, there are more and more potential dangers, they are dynamic, want to assert themselves and discover everything around them, love, sex... This is the nib. Explosion leads to abortions occurring continuously at this age. Because they do not understand the danger of the problem and how to prevent it. Therefore, the number of abortions in adolescents is very large (according to the statistics of the health organization, each year there are about 5000 abortions, of which 20% are in teenagers). And this situation has left many sad consequences for the children in the future. To raise the alarm about the current state of abortion among young people today, so that you can better understand this issue, the danger and the importance of reproductive health. Therefore, I have chosen the topic "Effect of abortion on adolescent reproductive health in Vietnam" as the topic for my thematic article "Reproductive health". Researching the problem, I would like to present the status of the problem and the effects of abortion on reproductive health. Then find out the cause and find solutions to overcome the above situation.

                                Adolescence is a concept that has not been agreed upon. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the age group 10-19 years old is the adolescent age, the European Union (EU) Program on Reproductive Health / Sexual Health Adolescents and Youths of the European Union (EU) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) ages 15-24.
                                In Vietnam, adolescence is the age from 10 to 18 years old. Youth are between 16 - 24 years old. Children who are protected by law are under the age of 16. Legally a minor is under the age of 18. The Vietnam Family Planning Association defines adolescents and young adults as 10-24 years old.

                            <p class="lead">
                                Abortion is simply understood as a means of ending a pregnancy. It can happen in 2 ways: by chance or on purpose. Most abortions have a purpose. Exceptions, i.e. "accidental" abortions, are performed due to defects in the mother or the child, sometimes both. These are called "spontaneous abortions" to distinguish them from cases that are not accidental, but are referred to as "a little too strong" as "criminal abortion". This is confusing because some cases of "crime of abortion" are done spontaneously. It is better to call this second form "intentional abortion" or "intentional abortion".

                                The dangerous type of abortion is probably the "sneaky" and "wild" type of abortion in which a pregnant woman inserts chemicals into her own uterus. Some pregnant girlfriends were so scared and didn't go to the hospital. In home conditions, you tortured yourself by inserting chemicals into your vagina or intravenously to abort. After such surreptitious surgeries, the risk of normal infertility is four times higher. Danger can also occur with abortions that are too large beyond 12 weeks of age. In these cases, with radical curettage, various lesions of the cervix will occur. One of the dangers is that the fetal bones are too large, which can scratch or puncture the uterus. For girls with tumors, abortion is also very dangerous.

                                <p class="drop-cap">Psychological: Along with physical and physiological changes, the psychological life of adolescents also has profound changes. They gradually become self-reliant psychologically, emotionally, and emotionally about gender, and at the same time think about their future role in society. This process takes place gradually, bringing many. emotional for the children but sometimes unstable. The following are some of the prominent psychophysiological characteristics of this age group. Sense of self-esteem, independence in thought and action: At this age, children tend to separate. Less dependent on parents. They have the mentality of wanting to be adults, seeing themselves as adults.” They no longer go with their parents, want to choose their own friends, and want to dress as they like. The children no longer confided in their parents, but switched from family activities to friends activities, admiring their idols. Feelings towards self: Biological changes sometimes have a psychological impact on adolescents. They have the need to explore their bodies and those of the opposite sex (or notice and wonder about body changes). Gender Emotions: Adolescent development has stimulated children to become interested in friends of the opposite sex, giving rise to novel gender-emotional feelings. These novelty vibes are sometimes fleeting and sometimes lingering. However, not all of them have such vibes, some of them are soon drawn into the path of love. These children's moods change rapidly and fluctuate wildly. Reason is not enough to help them master the intense vibrations of love too soon. In the process of exploring this discovery, children need to practice life skills to help them build friendships, resolve conflicts, know how to cooperate with others in groups, form self-esteem as well as being able to resist pressure from peers and other adults to not engage in risky behaviors that are harmful to the health and safety of self and others.
